# fstodo
What does the world need? That's right, another todo app. 

This time the app is written in F# and was put together very quickly to demonstrate how you might code against Android with F# as well as understanding project concepts.

I'll tweak this later to use SqliteAsyncConnection and make it more functional. Its feels too OOP for my taste right now, but because we are using Android, we have to connect in with its framework, which is OOP anyway so there will be some overlap. In my mobiles apps I find that I am calling out to modules and I'm using more functional concepts such as modules, lists, tuples and records.

I also want to add some thanks and a shoutout to praeclarum for SQLite.NET and to rachelreese because it showed there needed to be an Android counterpart to her F# iOS Tasky app
