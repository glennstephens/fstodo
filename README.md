# fstodo
What does the world need? That's right, another todo app. 

This time the app is written in F# and was put together very quickly to demonstrate how you might code against Android with F# as well as understanding project concepts.

Its serves a better purpose, it feels very OOP rather than functional at the moment, but will probably tweak this a little bit later to use the SqliteAsyncConnection and make it a little more functional. Its feels a little too OOP for my taste right now
