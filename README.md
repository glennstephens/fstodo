# fstodo
What does the world need? That's right, another todo app. 

This time the app is written in F# and was put together very quickly to demonstrate how you might code against Android with F# as well as understanding project concepts.

I'll edit this some more, but will tweak it later to use SqliteAsyncConnection and make it more functional. Its feels a little too OOP for my taste right now.

Thanks and a shoutout to praeclarum for SQLite.NET and to rachelreese because it showed there needed to be an Android counterpart to her F# iOS Tasky app
